One of the things I admire about the DevOps movement is the emphasis on breaking down artificial walls between different disciplines in
tech. While there are _many_ misinterpretations and hold-outs, perhaps the most interesting to me is the doublespeak about software
defects aka bugs. 

Consider the common refrain that something "is not a bug, it's an undocumented feature", or the insistence that a client's inability to use a 
feature due to a infrastructural hiccup is not a bug. Somehow. 

Further into the gray area, consider when there's a mismatch 
between what a customer believes a system does and the specification that a product team built against. Semantic aerobatics and finger pointing
aside. we must consider that the product we deliver is much larger than just code or the specific artifacts that are shipped. 

I'd argue that **anytime expectations aren't met by the people paying your bills, you've got a bug - and it needs to be dealt with.**
Aligning around this conclusion changes the way your entire organization operates together.
